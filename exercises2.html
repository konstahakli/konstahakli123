    <h1>Metallica Black Album</h1>
    <p> <img src="assets/images/Metallica.jpg" alt="opensource image" style="float:right; margin-left: 15px;"> <b>Metallica</b> (commonly known as The <b><i>Black Album</i></b>) is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on August 12, 1991, by Elektra Records. 
        Recording sessions took place at One on One Studios in Los Angeles over an eight-month span that frequently found Metallica at odds with their new producer Bob Rock. 
        The album marked a change in the band's music from the thrash metal style of their previous four albums to a slower, heavier, and more refined sound.</p>
    <p> Metallica received widespread critical acclaim and became the band's best-selling album. 
        It debuted at number one in ten countries and spent four consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard 200,</p>
